1. book category selection and book pages

Book category selection refers to the process of categorizing a book into a specific genre or subject area, which helps readers find books that match their interests. Common book categories include fiction, non-fiction, mystery, romance, science fiction, history, self-help, and many more.
"Book pages" typically refers to the number of pages in a book, indicating its length. Books can vary widely in page count, from a few dozen pages in a short story or children's book to hundreds or even thousands of pages in epic novels or reference materials. Page count can affect a book's reading time and physical size.

2.book details page

A book details page is a webpage or section of a website that provides comprehensive information about a specific book. It typically includes details such as the book's title, author, publisher, publication date, genre, a brief summary or blurb, cover image, ISBN, and often user reviews and ratings. Book details pages are commonly found on online bookstores, library catalogs, and book-related websites, allowing readers to learn more about a book before making a purchase or borrowing decision.

3. Authentication and User Management:

 Implement email and password-based authentication for user registration and login. Users should be able to toggle between the registration and login views. Display error messages when password requirements are not met during registration or when login credentials don't match. Additionally, provide at least one extra login method, such as social media (e.g., Google, Facebook, or GitHub) authentication. Once a user is logged in, display their username and profile picture in the navbar and include a logout button for easy session management.

 4. Book Submission:*

 Create an "Add Book" page with a form that allows users to submit new books to the website. The form should include fields for uploading an image, providing book details (name, type, price, short description, rating), and a button to add the book to the website's database. Ensure that this is a private/protected route.

 5. borrowed book

 Borrowing a book refers to the act of temporarily taking a book from a library or another individual with the intention of returning it after a certain period. Borrowing allows people to read books without the need to purchase them, and it's a common practice in libraries, where patrons can check out books for a specified loan period before returning them. It's a cost-effective way to access and enjoy a wide variety of books.
